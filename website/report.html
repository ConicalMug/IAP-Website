      <h2 class="content-header-2">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="content-text">In this report, I will be discussing the various design and development choices that I made in the creation of this website. This will include explanations on the layout, colour scheme and several other components.</p>
    </div>

      <h2 class="content-header-2">Disclaimer</h2>
      <p class="content-text">Any and all HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML present on this website was written by myself unless stated otherwise. References are given in the bottom section of the report to any external resources used in the making of this website.</p>

    <div class="report-section">
      <h2 class="content-header-2">Layout</h2>
      <p class="content-text">The layout of a webpage is one of its most important components and this is particularly true of a commercial website, as the intent is to grab the attention of potential customers and draw them to what you want to sell. With that in mind, I decided to see how commercial sites out there in the world handled their layouts to see what I could incorporate into my own project.</p>
      <div class="report-section">
        <h3 class="content-header-3">Amazon</h3>
        <p class="content-text-img">Amazon is one of the most popular shopping websites in the world, so it was naturally the first place to look when coming up with layout ideas for my website. The most immediately noticeable element is the header. The logo is firmly in the top left of the screen, and important features such as signing in or registering an account are in the opposite corner.<br><br>I decided to utilise this in my website's layout. As Amazon is such a big site, most people shopping online are likely familiar with its layout. For this reason, it is best to emulate it on my own website for ease of use.</p>

      <div class="report-section">
        <h3 class="content-header-3">Ebay</h3>
        <p class="content-text-img">Ebay is another popular shopping website in the UK and was the second one that I decided to take inspiration on. The header is used in a similar way to Amazon, holding the logo in the top left and having important elements either on the bottom or in the top right corner.<br><br>What is also of note in Ebay's design (as well as Amazon's) is a product slideshow being featured right below the header. This is so that customers can immediately begin browsing products rather than having to scroll for content. I knew that I wanted my website to function in a similar way, which is why my product slideshow is one of the first things that the user can see on the index page.</p>

      <h2 class="content-header-2">Colour Scheme</h2>
      <p class="content-text">The colour scheme was one of the first issues that arose when designing the basic components of the website. I needed to use a style that would be easy on the eyes and also make it simple for users to determine which parts of the website they should be directing their attention to.</p>
      <img class="report-img" src="images\report\colour_scheme.png" alt="Website colour scheme" title="Website colour scheme" width="40%" height="40%">
      <p class="content-text caption"><em>The inspiration for the colour scheme, including several of the specific hex values, was found using the website "colorhunt.io"<br>(reference located at the bottom of this report).</em></p>
      <p class="content-text">In the end, I settled on a scheme focused on the colour blue. The header and footer both use light text on a darker background, while the opposite is true for most of the site's other content. I found that this was a pleasing combination of colours to look at. I also had friends browse the website to see if they found the colour scheme appealing and they agreed.</p>

      <h2 class="content-header-2">Registration Form</h2>
      <p class="content-text">For this assignment, the registration form does not need to send user data anywhere. However, it does need to valid user inputs as well as make sure they provide all of the information that the website is looking for.<br><br>To make things easy to understand for users, I opted to make use of red asterisks (<span class="asterisk">*</span>) to indicate to users which fields are required and which are not. This is a common design feature on many websites, particularly those that make use of home addresses because of the various optional components many of them can have, such as house names.<br><br>I also made use of the "required" attribute to ensure the users enter something into fields containing essential information. A "pattern" attribute is used for mobile phone numbers so that a valid UK number format is entered. Lastly, certain fields, such as the email input, are of the email type, meaning that users have to include an @ symbol for the input to be considered valid.<br><br>Once all of the required data has been given and validated, an alert message will tell the user that their registration was successful.</p>

    <div class="report-section">
      <h2 class="content-header-2">Product Display</h2>
      <p class="content-text">In order to display my products, I had to read them from an XML file using JavaScript. A table was used to format the products in a clean and easy-to-understand tile format, which can be found on many technology websites as it makes side-by-side comparisons slightly easier for users.</p>
      <img class="report-img" src="images\report\products.png" alt="Products" title="Products" width="60%" height="60%">
      <p class="content-text caption"><em>The products are laid out in a table format, using a blue tile theme.</em></p>
      <p class="content-text">Xpath was used to locate the products (in the products.xml file) and two JavaScript functions are used to load the file and display the products accordingly. The full code used can be found with comments in the source of products.html.</p>

    <hr class="sub-rule">
    <div class="report-section">
      <h2 class="content-header-2">Product Slideshow</h2>
      <p class="content-text">As I alluded to earlier, one key feature of both Amazon and Ebay is a product slideshow on the homepage. It is immediately noticeable to viewers and they can then browse through a small selection of products or promotions. I decided to place mine front and centre in index.html, and clicking the slideshow will bring the users to products.html where they can read the descriptions for the items that they have seen.</p>
      <div class="report-section">
        <h3 class="content-header-3">The Slideshow</h3>
        <p class="content-text-img">The slideshow is programmed in JavaScript, and displays images in a slides folder by rotating them in and out of visibility when the user presses one of several buttons. To the left and right of each slide are buttons to view either the next or previous product, and on the bottom of the slideshow are some circular buttons that can be pressed to jump to a specific slide.<br><br>The slideshow uses the same products that can be found in products.xml so that the user can click on them to explore them in more detail on the dedicated products page. The slideshow itself uses rounded elements and a somewhat blue colour scheme, to allow it to fit in with the rest of the site.</p>
