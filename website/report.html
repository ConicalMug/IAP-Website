    <h2 class="content-header-2">Colour Scheme</h2>
    <p class="content-text">The colour scheme was one of the first issues that arose when designing the basic components of the website. I needed to use a style that would be easy on the eyes and also make it simple for users to determine which parts of the website they should be directing their attention to.</p>
    <p class="content-text">In the end, I settled on a scheme focused on the colour blue, with darker shades taking up much of the background with lighter text on top. I found that this was a pleasing combination of colours to look at. I also had friends browse the website to see if they found the colour scheme appealing and they agreed.</p>
