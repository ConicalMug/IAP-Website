      <h2 class="content-header-2">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="content-text">In this report, I will be discussing the various design and development choices that I made in the creation of this website. This will include explanations on the layout, colour scheme and several other components.</p>

      <h2 class="content-header-2">Layout</h2>
      <p class="content-text">The layout of a webpage is one of its most important components and this is particularly true of a commerical website, as the intent is to grab the attention of potential customers and draw them to what you want to sell. With that in mind, I decided to see how commerical sites out there in the world handled their layouts to see what I could incorporate into my own project.</p>
      <div class="report-section">
        <h3 class="content-header-3">Amazon</h3>
        <p class="content-text-img">Amazon is one of the most popular shopping websites in the world, so it was naturally the first place to look when coming up with layout ideas for my website. The most immeditely noticeable element is the header. The logo is firmly in the top left of the screen, and important features such as signing in or registering an account are in the opposite corner.<br><br>I decided to utilise this in my website's layout. As Amazon is such a big site, most people shopping online are likely familiar with its layout. For this reason, it is best to emulate it on my own website for ease of use.</p>

        <h3 class="content-header-3">Ebay</h3>
        <p class="content-text-img">Ebay is another popular shopping website in the UK and was the second one that I decided to take inspiration on. The header is used in a similar way to Amazon, holding the logo in the top left and having important elements either on the bottom or in the top right corner.<br><br>What is also of note in Ebay's design (as well as Amazon's) is a product slideshow being featured right below the header. This is so that customers can immediately begin browsing products rather than having to scroll for content. I knew that I wanted my website to function in a similar way, which is why my product slideshow is one of the first things that the user can see on the index page.</p>

      <h2 class="content-header-2">Colour Scheme</h2>
      <p class="content-text">The colour scheme was one of the first issues that arose when designing the basic components of the website. I needed to use a style that would be easy on the eyes and also make it simple for users to determine which parts of the website they should be directing their attention to.</p>
      <img class="report-img" src="images\report\colour_scheme.png" alt="Website colour scheme" title="Website colour scheme" width="40%" height="40%">
      <p class="content-text caption"><em>The inspiration for the colour scheme, including several of the specific hex values, was found using the website "colorhunt.io"<br>(reference located at the bottom of this report).</em></p>
      <p class="content-text">In the end, I settled on a scheme focused on the colour blue. The header and footer both use light text on a darker background, while the opposite is true for most of the site's other content. I found that this was a pleasing combination of colours to look at. I also had friends browse the website to see if they found the colour scheme appealing and they agreed.</p>
